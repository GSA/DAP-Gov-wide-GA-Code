# Security Policy

Services operated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)
are covered by the **GSA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**. See the [policy page](https://gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy) for details including:

* GSA's coordinated disclosure policy.
* Information on how you may conduct security research on GSA developed
  software and systems.
* Important legal and policy guidance.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues should be reported via GitHub [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) (requires a GitHub account) or by sending an email to <dap@gsa.gov>.

Security issues may also be reported to the GSA Vulnerability Disclosure Program, following instructions in the policy linked above. However, we ask that you report directly to us as well, to ensure that the issue will be reviewed quickly.
