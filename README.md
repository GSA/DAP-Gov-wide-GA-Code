## Digital Analytics Program government-wide code

Provides a JavaScript file for US federal agencies to link or embed in their websites to participate in the Digital Analytics Program.

The most current version of DAP GA code is:

* [`Universal-Federated-Analytics.js`](Universal-Federated-Analytics.js) (full)
* [`Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js`](Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js) (minified)

### Central hosting

The central URLs for the Digital Analytics Program JS snippet are:

* `https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics.js` (full)
* `https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js` (minified)

Agencies are encouraged to use the following HTML snippet to participate in the Digital Analytics Program:

```html
<!-- We participate in the US government's analytics program. See the data at analytics.usa.gov. -->
<script id="_fed_an_ua_tag" src="https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js" async></script>
```

#### Transport security

The centrally hosted DAP JS is only available over HTTPS. Making any request over HTTP will be immediately redirected to HTTPS.

Additionally, an [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://https.cio.gov/hsts/) header is set with a length of 1 year, and is prepared for preloading into major web browsers. As of this writing, that header looks like this:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;preload
```

Browsers that support HSTS and which have observed this HSTS policy (either from a prior visit or through HSTS preloading) will not issue HTTP requests to dap.digitalgov.gov at all, even if instructed.

Together, HTTPS and HSTS offer a strong, necessary level of transport security and integrity.

#### Data integrity

The `dap.digitalgov.gov` domain is currently served by Akamai. Akamai's servers are configured to cache the contents of the following URLs:

* `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-analytics-program/DAP-Gov-wide-GA-Code/master/Universal-Federated-Analytics.js` (full)
* `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-analytics-program/DAP-Gov-wide-GA-Code/master/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js` (minified)

These URLs are not hit directly by users, but used by Akamai's servers to fetch the latest code that should be served to users.

These URLs serve the **current public version of the DAP code** as versioned in this repository's `master` branch. **There is no intermediate step** between committing to `master` and updating the code on `dap.digitalgov.gov`.

This means that, assuming GitHub's systems are not compromised in some way, and assuming GitHub's `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` domain is not impersonated on a hostile network, **all** changes to the code that appears on `dap.digitalgov.gov` should be publicly reflected in [this repository's commit history](https://github.com/digital-analytics-program/gov-wide-code/commits/master).
